pyFC is a module to construct "fractal cubes" that are useful for initial conditions in hydrodynamical simulations representing a dense, inhomogeneous component embedded in a more tenuous smooth background. Examples include clouds in earth's athmosphere or the multiphase interstellar medium in galaxies. 

Classes and functions are provided to create and visualize single-point lognormal, two-point fractal fields, statistics often associated with turbulent, dense condensations.

The method of creating lognormal "fractal cubes" was conceived by `Lewis & Austin (2002)`_ for the modeling of clouds in the earth's atmosphere. The scheme of this code is based on that outlined in their paper.
