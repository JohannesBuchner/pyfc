Lognormal Fractal Cubes
=======================

The main functionality of the pyFC module is to generate fractal cube for a field rho, which has the following two statistical properties:

  1. Single-point lognormal probability distribution characterized by the mean, mu, and variance, sigma^2 of the distribution.
  2. Two-point fractal distribution, characterised by the slope of the power-law spectrum in Fourier space, beta, the Nyquist limit k_max, and a lower cutoff wavenumber, k_min. 
     
Note that, although we refer to fractal cubes as cubes, they may in fact be cuboidal. The code, however, only properly supports cubes currently, that is n_i = n_j = n_k

The Nyquist limit, k_max_i = (ni + 1)/2. The lower cutoff wave number restricts sampling, and therefore fractal structure, to scales smaller than L/k_min, where L is the width of the cube. This is a useful parameter in controlling the size scale (or column depth) of structure in the fractal cube.

Fractal cubes are generated by the following iterative procedure. Details can be found in Lews & Austin (2002):

  1. Construct in real space a cube of random variables with a Gaussian distribution, with mean mu_g, and variance, sigma_g.
  2. Exponentiate the cube to obtain a random lognormal field.
  3. Use a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain the power spectrum of the field.



Gaussian Fractal Cubes
----------------------
A class and functions also exist to generate fractal cubes with single-point Gaussian statistics, described by the mean and variance. These are useful to generate velocity dispersions. 

Future work includes combining lognormal and Gaussian fractal cubes in a consistent way to be used in hydrodynamic simulations.
